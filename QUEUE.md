# QUEUE

## Red flags

Security, privacy, and data-exposure risks Claude has surfaced — kept at the top so they're the first thing seen each session. Each carries a state: open, resolved, or accepted. Empty until a risk comes up.

(none surfaced yet)

## Batches

Worked top to bottom. Each batch is one /next session. Subheadings name the kind of work (Build, Test, Audit).

The detailed original spec for each build batch is archived at `archive/backlog-specs/` — the filename matches the batch number/slug. These came from the old folder-based backlog; the entry below is the summary, the archived file is the full spec.

**Run /plan before building.** Several batches below depend on open design questions still sitting in Captures (carried over from the old backlog's "Planning batches"). /plan resolves those and folds the answers into SPEC.md before the dependent build runs.

- **0020 — remote-mcp-server** — Hosted MCP server with tool surface and system-prompt delivery.
**SYSTEM-PROMPT.md — reconciliation: pending-suggestion supersession** **[sysprompt-reconciliation-supersession]**
Serves SYSTEM-PROMPT.md.

`SYSTEM-PROMPT.md` describes Strategy-doc reconciliation but doesn't say what happens when the user submits a new Strategy edit while a prior reconciliation's suggestions are still unanswered. Decided in planning 2026-06-16: the new edit wins. This batch writes that rule into the doc so the reconciliation feature (batch 0021) is built against a complete description.

Build:
- Edit `SYSTEM-PROMPT.md` → §Strategy doc reconciliation → *Ongoing reconciliation*: add that a new Strategy doc edit submitted while prior suggestions are still pending triggers fresh reconciliation against the latest version, superseding (folding in) the prior pass's unanswered suggestions rather than stacking them. Keep one line of rationale in the doc: stale suggestions against a superseded version confuse; newest text is the source of truth.

- **0021 — strategy-doc-reconciliation-paid-tier** — Initial and ongoing Strategy doc reconciliation via Claude.
- **0022 — help-thanks-report-a-bug-content** — Bottom-of-drawer screen content including help and custom instructions.

### Parked

## Deferred tests

Planned tests that couldn't run in their own session. /plan rolls the runnable ones into a test batch.

- **Batch 0001 — TaskDao instrumentation tests (10 tests).** Create-with-date, create-without-date, park on Soon/Later, assign/refile Project FK, reorder within slot and within project, create subtask, subtask completion roll-up (TEST-LOG #002–011). Build now compiles (TEST-LOG #001 resolved 2026-06-16), so these are no longer build-blocked. Still can't run: no Android emulator (AVD) or device is available on this machine. Runnable once an emulator is created or a device is connected — user-run, or I can run them if a device is reachable.

## Captures

Captured outside /plan. Picked up and routed during the next /plan session.

(Raw captures collect below this line, then get processed and moved above it during /plan.)

### Parked

- **Subscription pause — Play Billing pause mechanics.** Verify what Google Play Billing actually exposes for subscription pause (largely Play-Store-controlled, not app-controlled). Staleness-prone, so check at build time, not now.
  Blocked by: the subscription-handling build (queue entry 0017) — behavioural trigger, no slug yet (0017 is still a rough placeholder); confirm the Play Billing pause API when that batch is authored.
- **Subscription pause — multi-device resume merge.** Policy is decided (paused → revert to local-only). Open: when a paused multi-device user resumes, which device's local state wins / how to merge. Entangled with cloud-sync design.
  Blocked by: the cloud-sync build (queue entry 0018) — behavioural trigger, no slug yet; decide the resume-merge strategy when that batch is designed.
- **Custom instruction text — production version.** The suggested proactive-use custom-instruction text (for users' Claude preferences) needs testing in Alex's own real use before publishing. Once tested, document in Help (0022) and fold into SYSTEM-PROMPT.md if relevant.
  Blocked by: Alex testing the proactive custom-instruction in her own Claude use — behavioural trigger, no slug; needs the app usable first.
- **Empty state copy and visuals.** Write copy + visuals for each empty state: Schedule screens with zero tasks, an empty Project, and the Projects list before any Project exists (the empty-Projects state does pedagogical work per SPEC). Best written in front of the real screen, not against screens that don't exist yet.
  Blocked by: the screen-rendering builds reaching their polish pass (0002 Schedule, 0003 side menu / Projects, 0004 Project view) — behavioural, no slug; write each empty state against the real screen.
- **Help, Thanks, Report a bug content.** Content for the three bottom-of-drawer screens (batch 0022). Help should cover MCP setup, the production custom-instruction text, and the "tasks dated before today" behaviour described without naming the category (the SPEC §Tasks dated before today wording is ready).
  Blocked by: the production custom-instruction text (itself parked, behavioural) and the MCP setup design (0019/0020) — write Help content when 0022 is built and those inputs are ready.
- **Search.** Confirmed feature, deferred. There IS a search box — finding tasks gets overwhelming at volume. Design decided: search results display like the in-Project/category listing — task details are visible but a task CANNOT be marked complete from the results list (read-only display). Tapping a result navigates to where the task actually lives, so the user can complete or edit it there. Still to pin at build time: search scope (current screen / current Project / whole database — tasks + Projects + Strategy doc).
  Parked: confirmed for a later build, no batch yet; revisit when scoping post-core work. When unparked it needs a spec-edit (add §Search to SPEC) plus a feature batch.
- **Navigation zoom-spine and completed-history** **[nav-zoom-spine-and-completed-history]**
  Parked: large navigation-redesign + completed-history design thread; deferred by choice to its own /plan pass. Trigger-less — revisit when you decide to take up the nav redesign. Grew out of [completed-task-post-tray-fate] during /plan 2026-06-17 (evidence citation, not a dependency).

  **Designer-side rationale ("zoom levels of time" — not user-facing copy).** Like zooming from particles to an apple to a landscape, order is visible at some zoom levels and not others. Here the order is time arranged in days/weeks. Tasks sit messily inside a day; a day nests into a week; past about a week, time stops being the useful frame and projects/strategy take over — which don't slice into equal increments the way days do. This is why the navigation can glide cleanly left-to-right from arranging *time* into arranging *projects*: the app moves fluently across zoom levels rather than forcing everything onto a clock. Concept is for us, not the user.

  **The spine (main navigation).** One left-to-right line of full pages, mirrored top-to-bottom in the side menu: **Search · Yesterday · Today · Tomorrow · Soon · Later · Projects · Strategy.** Today is still the default open page. Swipe moves between adjacent pages; the menu jumps directly.

  **Completed-history (the Search page).** The leftmost page lists completed tasks in completion order, most recent at top, with date headers between days. Typing a search narrows what shows below; the relevant date headers still display above each day's results.

  **Day-detail card layer (a separate axis).** Tapping a result, a group, or a date header opens that day on a **card in the foreground** — deliberately a *different* left-right axis from the spine, signalled by the card visual. Swipe right = previous (older) day slides in from the left; swipe left = next (newer) day slides in from the right. Swiping left past the newest card (day-before-yesterday) slides the whole card layer *and* the Search page off in one smooth motion, returning the user to the main spine, landing on **Yesterday**. Yesterday itself is a spine page, not a card. Only from a day card can the user tap a single task to edit or uncomplete it.

  **Share-a-day.** A share button on a day screen shares that single day's completed tasks. Format open — leaning PNG or PDF (PNG seen as most universally readable and still printable); plain-text and app-sensitive output also considered. Reconcile with the existing Strategy-doc share button, which uses the Android share sheet.

  **SPEC consequences when developed.** Rewrites principle 3's wording (Projects also reached via the spine, not only the side menu — keep "not slices of the day"), the Schedule-view "four discrete swipeable screens" framing, and the three-section side-menu structure. Likely revises batches 0002 / 0003 / 0004 and adds new feature batches. Supersedes spec-trim findings F3, F4, F18 — hold those when processing the trim. (F5 is the Project view's internal card layout, which the nav change doesn't rewrite, so it was trimmed normally.)

  **Open sub-questions (must resolve before this can promote):**
  1. Reconcile with the parked Search feature (find *active* tasks, read-only results, tap to jump to where the task lives). Is the leftmost page completed-history only, with active-task search separate/later — or one unified search covering both?
  2. Share format (PNG / PDF / plain text / app-sensitive) — research-worthy before deciding.
  3. v1 vs post-core scope — how much of this set ships in v1.
  4. Swipe and card-layer interaction detail — best finalized against a real screen.
- **Onboarding video content.** The multi-page onboarding video must demonstrate Claude/MCP value concretely (for the free-vs-paid choice). Can't be produced until the Claude/MCP integration exists to film. Sequencing note: onboarding (0016) is queued ahead of the MCP work, so 0016 may need to ship with a placeholder video and have the real one added once the integration lands.
  Blocked by: the Claude/MCP integration builds (0019 AI-choice / MCP setup, 0020 remote MCP server, 0021 reconciliation) — behavioural, no slug; produce the video once there's a working integration to demonstrate.
- **Post-first-test polish review.** After the first end-to-end test, walk the test notes and decide which polish issues warrant their own SPEC.md entry and which fold into existing ones — polish that doesn't trace to SPEC.md is a capture, not a build item.
  Blocked by: the first end-to-end test having happened — behavioural, no slug; when it lands, run a /plan polish-review pass over the test notes.
